[AssemblyAI API Postman collection](https://assembly.ai/postman)

## Quickstart[â€‹](#quickstart "Direct link to Quickstart")

1. 1

   Open the [AssemblyAI API collection](https://assembly.ai/postman) in Postman and click the **Fork** button. This will create a copy of the collection that you can edit.

   ![Click Fork on the AssemblyAI API collection](/images/docs/integrations/docs/assets/images/1-fork-collection-fdfce7e4acc15dbf6afbdb73be16a7bd.png)

   Fill out the form and click **Fork Collection**.

2. 2

   Next, click on the **Variables** tab and configure the `apiKey` variable with your AssemblyAI API key. You can find your AssemblyAI API key in the [AssemblyAI dashboard](https://www.assemblyai.com/dashboard/login).

3. 3

   Let's upload an audio file:

   1. Open the **Files > Upload a media file** request
   2. Switch to the **Body** tab
   3. Change the dropdown from **none** to **binary**
   4. Select an audio file of your choosing, or [download this sample audio file](https://assembly.ai/nbc.mp3)
   5. Click the **Send** button

   ![Send upload audio file to AssemblYAI API HTTP request](/images/docs/integrations/docs/assets/images/3-upload-file-request-bfebf556bf39c0561bda25dafbdc2a71.png)

   Inspect the **Body** of the response and copy the `upload_url` value.

4. 4

   Now that the audio file is uploaded, you can transcribe the audio file.

   1. Open the **Transcripts > Transcribe audio** request
   2. Switch to the **Body** tab
   3. Find the `audio_url` property and update it to the `upload_url` value from the previous request.
   4. Remove all the other properties. Optionally, you can leave any property that you do want to use.
   5. Click the **Send** button

   Inspect the **Body** of the response and copy the `id` value.

5. 5

   The transcription job will take longer depending on the duration of the file. You need to check the `status` property to check if a transcript is ready. The `status` goes from `queued` to `processing` to `completed`. The `status` can also become `error` at any point. If an error occurs, you can find the error message under the `error` property.

   1. Open the **Transcripts > Get transcript** request
   2. Find the `transcript_id` under **Path variables** and update the value with the `id` value from the previous request.
   3. Remove all the other properties. Optionally, you can leave any property that you do want to use.
   4. Click the **Send** button

   ![Get a transcript HTTP request and response](/images/docs/integrations/docs/assets/images/7-get-transcript-5780ccd99a57a5cf64f3ffce750fa42c.png)

   Inspect the **Body** of the response to check if the `status` is `completed` or `error`. If not, resend the request until it is `completed` or `error`.

6. 6

   Now that you have a completed transcript, you can send these other HTTP requests with your current transcript ID:

   * Transcripts

     * Get subtitles for transcript
     * Get sentences in transcript
     * Get paragraphs in transcript
     * Search words in transcript
     * Get redacted audio (if PII audio redaction is enabled)

   * LeMUR

     * Run a task using LeMUR
     * Summarize a transcript using LeMUR
     * Ask questions using LeMUR
     * Extract action items

   Let's prompt an LLM to summarize the transcript using LeMUR:

   1. Open the **LeMUR > Run a task using LeMUR** request
   2. Switch to the **Body** tab
   3. Find the `transcript_ids` property and replace the sample ID with your transcript ID
   4. Set the `final_model` property to `"anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet"`
   5. Set the `prompt` property to `"Summarize the transcript"`
   6. Remove the other properties
   7. Click the **Send** button
