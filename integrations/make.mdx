title: "Integrate Make with AssemblyAI"
description: "Make (formerly Integromat) is a workflow automation tool that lets you integrate various services together without requiring coding knowledge."

With the AssemblyAI app for Make, you can use our AI models to process audio data by transcribing it with speech recognition models, analyzing it with audio intelligence models, and building generative features on top of it with LLMs. You can supply audio to the AssemblyAI app and connect the output of our models to other services in your Make scenarios.

## Quickstart[​](#quickstart "Direct link to Quickstart")

1. 1

   Create or edit a scenario in Make. Add a new module, search for AssemblyAI, and select the module that you want to use.

## AssemblyAI app modules[​](#assemblyai-app-modules "Direct link to AssemblyAI app modules")

The AssemblyAI app for Make provides the following modules:

### Files[​](#files "Direct link to Files")

#### Upload a File[​](#upload-a-file "Direct link to Upload a File")

Upload an audio file to AssemblyAI so you can transcribe it. You can pass the `Upload URL` output field to the `Audio URL` input field of [Transcribe an Audio File](#transcribe-an-audio-file) module.

### Transcripts[​](#transcripts "Direct link to Transcripts")

#### Transcribe an Audio File[​](#transcribe-an-audio-file "Direct link to Transcribe an Audio File")

Transcribe an audio file and wait until the transcript has completed or failed. Configure the `Audio URL` field with the URL of the audio file you want to transcribe. The `Audio URL` must be accessible by AssemblyAI's servers. If you don't have a publicly accessible URL, you can use the [Upload a File](#upload-a-file) module to upload the audio file to AssemblyAI.

If you don't want to wait until the transcript is ready, change the `Wait until Transcript is Ready` parameter to `No` under **Show advanced settings**.

<Info>
  Configure your desired [Audio Intelligence models](/audio-intelligence) when you create the transcript. The results of the models will be included in the transcript output.
</Info>

#### Wait until Transcript is Ready[​](#wait-until-transcript-is-ready "Direct link to Wait until Transcript is Ready")

Wait for an existing transcript to be ready. This module will complete when the status of the transcript changes to "completed" or "error".

#### Watch for Transcript Ready Notification[​](#watch-for-transcript-ready-notification "Direct link to Watch for Transcript Ready Notification")

Create a webhook URL to receive a notification when a transcript is ready. When the transcript is ready, the webhook will be invoked with the transcript status and ID. The status will be "completed" or "error".

#### Get a Transcript[​](#get-a-transcript "Direct link to Get a Transcript")

Retrieve a transcript by ID.

#### Get Paragraphs of a Transcript[​](#get-paragraphs-of-a-transcript "Direct link to Get Paragraphs of a Transcript")

Retrieve the paragraphs of a transcript.

<Note>
  You can only invoke this module after the transcript is completed.
</Note>

#### Get Sentences of a Transcript[​](#get-sentences-of-a-transcript "Direct link to Get Sentences of a Transcript")

Retrieve the sentences of a transcript.

<Note>
  You can only invoke this module after the transcript is completed.
</Note>

#### Get Subtitles for a Transcript[​](#get-subtitles-for-a-transcript "Direct link to Get Subtitles for a Transcript")

Create SRT or VTT subtitles for a transcript.

<Note>
  You can only invoke this module after the transcript is completed.
</Note>

#### Get Redacted Audio of a Transcript[​](#get-redacted-audio-of-a-transcript "Direct link to Get Redacted Audio of a Transcript")

First, you need to configure PII audio redaction using these fields when you create the transcript:

* `Redact PII`: `Yes`
* `Redact PII Audio`: `Yes`
* `Redact PII Policies`: Configure at least one PII policy

Then, you can use this module to retrieve the redacted audio of the transcript.

<Note>
  You can only invoke this module after the transcript is completed.
</Note>

#### Search for Words in a Transcript[​](#search-for-words-in-a-transcript "Direct link to Search for Words in a Transcript")

Search for words in a transcript.

<Note>
  You can only invoke this module after the transcript is completed.
</Note>

#### List Transcripts[​](#list-transcripts "Direct link to List Transcripts")

Paginate over all transcripts.

#### Delete a Transcript[​](#delete-a-transcript "Direct link to Delete a Transcript")

Delete a transcript by ID. Deleting a transcript does not delete the transcript resource itself, but removes the data from the resource and marks it as deleted.

<Note>
  You can only invoke this module after the transcript status is "completed" or "error".
</Note>

### LeMUR[​](#lemur "Direct link to LeMUR")

#### Run a Task using LeMUR[​](#run-a-task-using-lemur "Direct link to Run a Task using LeMUR")

Prompt different LLMs over your audio data using LeMUR. You have to configure either the `Transcript IDs` or `Input Text` input field.

#### Purge a LeMUR Request[​](#purge-a-lemur-request "Direct link to Purge a LeMUR Request")

Delete the data for a previously submitted LeMUR request. Response data from the LLM, as well as any context provided in the original request will be removed.

### Other modules[​](#other-modules "Direct link to Other modules")

#### Make an API Call[​](#make-an-api-call "Direct link to Make an API Call")

Make your own REST API HTTP requests to the AssemblyAI API using your existing connection.
