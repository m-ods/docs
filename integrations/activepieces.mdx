With the AssemblyAI piece for Activepieces, you can use AssemblyAI to transcribe audio data with speech recognition models, analyze the data with audio intelligence models, and build generative features on top of it with LLMs. You can supply audio to the AssemblyAI piece and connect the output of any of AssemblyAI's models to other services in your Activepieces flow.

## AssemblyAI actions[​](#assemblyai-actions "Direct link to AssemblyAI actions")

The AssemblyAI piece for Activepieces provides the following actions:

### Files[​](#files "Direct link to Files")

#### Upload File[​](#upload-file "Direct link to Upload File")

Upload an audio file to AssemblyAI so you can transcribe it. You can pass the `Upload URL` output field to the `Audio URL` input field of [Transcribe an Audio File](#transcribe-an-audio-file) module.

### Transcripts[​](#transcripts "Direct link to Transcripts")

#### Transcribe[​](#transcribe "Direct link to Transcribe")

Transcribe an audio file and wait until the transcript has completed or failed. Configure the `Audio URL` field with the URL of the audio file you want to transcribe. The `Audio URL` must be accessible by AssemblyAI's servers. If you don't have a publicly accessible URL, you can use the [Upload a File](#upload-a-file) module to upload the audio file to AssemblyAI.

If you don't want to wait until the transcript is ready, uncheck the `Wait until transcript is ready` parameter.

<Info>
  Configure your desired [Audio Intelligence models](/docs/audio-intelligence) when you create the transcript. The results of the models will be included in the transcript output.
