## AssemblyAI LlamaIndex Integration[â€‹](#assemblyai-llamaindex-integration "Direct link to AssemblyAI LlamaIndex Integration")

[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai) is a flexible data framework for connecting custom data sources to [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/introduction-large-language-models-generative-ai/#what-are-language-models). With LlamaIndex, you can easily store and index your data, and then use them with LLMs to build applications. However, LLMs only work with textual data, so you need to transcribe the audio files to text first.

AssemblyAI has a LlamaIndex integration for both Python and JavaScript. Learn more about our language-specific integrations:
