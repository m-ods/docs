## Custom prompt example[​](#custom-prompt-example "Direct link to Custom prompt example")

If you want to send a custom prompt to the LLM, you can use the [LeMUR Task](https://assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/lemur/task) and apply the model to your transcribed audio files.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import assemblyai as aai

aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Step 1: Transcribe an audio file.
# audio_file = "./local_file.mp4"
audio_file = "https://assembly.ai/call.mp4"

transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
transcript = transcriber.transcribe(audio_file)

# Step 2: Define your prompt.
prompt = "What was the emotional sentiment of the phone call?"

# Step 3: Apply LeMUR.
result = transcript.lemur.task(
    prompt, final_model=aai.LemurModel.claude3_5_sonnet
)

print(result.response)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { AssemblyAI } from 'assemblyai'

const client = new AssemblyAI({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
})

const run = async () => {
  // Step 1: Transcribe an audio file.
  // const audioFile = './local_file.mp4'
  const audioFile = 'https://assembly.ai/call.mp4'
  const transcript = await client.transcripts.transcribe({ audio: audioFile })

  // Step 2: Define your prompt.
  const prompt = 'What was the emotional sentiment of the phone call?'

  // Step 3: Apply LeMUR.
  const { response } = await client.lemur.task({
    transcript_ids: [transcript.id],
    prompt,
    final_model: 'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet'
  })

  console.log(response)
}

run()
```
