## Get started[​](#get-started "Direct link to Get started")

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up](https://assemblyai.com/dashboard/signup) for a free account and get your API key from your dashboard.

The entire source code of this guide can be viewed [here](https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Community/docs-snippets/tree/main/summarizing).

## Step-by-step instructions[​](#step-by-step-instructions "Direct link to Step-by-step instructions")

1. 1

   Create a new file and import the necessary libraries for making an HTTP request.

2. 2

   Set up the API endpoint and headers. The headers should include your API key.

3. 3

   Upload your local file to the AssemblyAI API.

   We delete uploaded files from our servers either after the transcription has completed, or 24 hours after you uploaded the file. After the file has been deleted, the corresponding `upload_url` is no longer valid.

4. 4

   Use the `upload_url` returned by the AssemblyAI API to create a JSON payload containing the `audio_url` parameter.

   To use the Summarization model, set `summarization` to `True`. By default, the `summary_model` model is `informative` and the `summary_type` is `bullets`.

   You can find all possible [summary models and types here](/audio-intelligence/summarization#types-and-models). Note that if the `summary_model` is specified, `summary_type` is also a required parameter, and vice versa.

5. 5

   Make a `POST` request to the AssemblyAI API endpoint with the payload and headers.

6. 6

   After making the request, you'll receive an ID for the transcription. Use it to poll the API every few seconds to check the status of the transcript job. Once the status is `completed`, you can retrieve the transcript from the API response, using the `summary` key to view the result of the summarization.

## Understanding the response[​](#understanding-the-response "Direct link to Understanding the response")

Your transcript summary is located in the `summary` key of the API response. In addition to standard transcript metadata, you'll also find other parameters containing the `summary_type`, which indicates the type of summary that was generated, and `summary_model`, which indicates the specific AI summarization model that was used to generate the summary. More information on these parameters and their possible values can be found below.

Refer to the [API reference](https://assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/transcripts/get#response) for a breakdown of every element in your transcript output.

## Best practices[​](#best-practices "Direct link to Best practices")

Identify the most important information you want to include in the summary and choose the Summarization model and type that best suits your use case.

When using the `conversational` model, make sure that the two speakers have distinct voices and that there's minimal background noise. For shorter recordings, the `gist` or `headline` options may provide the most effective summary, whereas for longer recordings, the `bullets_verbose` or `paragraph` options may be more appropriate.

Consider the context in which the summary will be used, and whether additional context or explanation is necessary to understand the summary.

Experiment with different summarization options to find the one that works best for your specific use case.

| Summary model options                                                                                         | Summary type options                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `informative` (default): Best for files with a single speaker such as presentations or lectures.              | `bullets` (default): A bulleted summary with the most important points.                  |
| `conversational`: Best for any two-person conversation such as customer/agent or interview/interviewee calls. | `bullets_verbose`: A longer bullet point list summarizing the entire transcription text. |
| `catchy`: Best for creating video, podcast, or media titles.                                                  | `gist`: A few words summarizing the entire transcription text.                           |
|                                                                                                               | `headline`: A single sentence summarizing the entire transcription text.                 |
|                                                                                                               | `paragraph`: A single paragraph summarizing the entire transcription text.               |

## Conclusion[​](#conclusion "Direct link to Conclusion")

AssemblyAI maintains a number of different [summarization models](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/new-ai-models-to-summarize-audio-and-video-for-any-use-case/) for different use cases, so you can choose between a more informative summary or a catchier tagline for your audio. Visit the [AssemblyAI blog](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/automatically-summarize-audio-and-video-files-at-scale-with-ai/) for more examples of our summarization features in action.

If you're experiencing issues with generating a summary, make sure that you've included the `summarization` parameter in your request and set it to `true`. In addition, note that the [Auto Chapters](/audio-intelligence/auto-chapters) model and the Summarization model can't be active in the same request. If you try to enable both Auto Chapters and Summarization in a single request, you'll receive the following error message: `"Only one of the following models can be enabled at a time: auto_chapters, summarization."`
