## Basic Q\&A example[​](#basic-qa-example "Direct link to Basic Q\&A example")

If you want to send a custom prompt to the LLM, you can use the [LeMUR Task](https://assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/lemur/task) and apply the model to your transcribed audio files.

To ask question about your audio data, define a prompt with your questions and call `transcript.lemur.task()`. The underlying `transcript` is automatically used as additional context for the model.

#### Example output[​](#example-output "Direct link to Example output")

```
Based on the transcript, runner's knee is a condition characterizedby pain behind or around the kneecap. It is caused by overuse,muscle imbalance and inadequate stretching. Symptoms include painunder or around the kneecap and pain when walking.
```

## Q\&A with specialized endpoint[​](#qa-with-specialized-endpoint "Direct link to Q\&A with specialized endpoint")

The [LeMUR Question & Answer function](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/lemur/question-answer) requires no prompt engineering and facilitates more deterministic and structured outputs. You can use it with `transcript.lemur.question()`.

To use it, define a list of `aai.LemurQuestion` objects. For each question, you can define additional `context` and specify either a `answer_format` or a list of `answer_options`. Additionally, you can define an overall `context`.

## Custom Q\&A example (Advanced)[​](#custom-qa-example-advanced "Direct link to Custom Q\&A example (Advanced)")

This example shows how you can run a custom LeMUR task with an advanced prompt to create custom Q\&A responses:

## More Q\&A prompt examples[​](#more-qa-prompt-examples "Direct link to More Q\&A prompt examples")

Try any of these prompts to get started:

| Use case               | Example prompt                                                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Question and answer    | *"Identify any patterns or trends based on the transcript"*          |
| Closed-ended questions | *"Did the customer express a positive sentiment in the phone call?"* |
| Sentiment analysis     | *"What was the emotional sentiment of the phone call?"*              |
