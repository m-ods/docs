## Basic summary example[​](#basic-summary-example "Direct link to Basic summary example")

If you want to send a custom prompt to the LLM, you can use the [LeMUR Task](https://assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/lemur/task) and apply the model to your transcribed audio files.

To summarize the content in your audio data, define a summarization prompt and call `transcript.lemur.task()`. The underlying `transcript` is automatically used as additional context for the model.

#### Example output[​](#example-output "Direct link to Example output")

```
The transcript describes several common sports injuries - runner's knee,sprained ankle, meniscus tear, rotator cuff tear, and ACL tear. It providesdefinitions, causes, and symptoms for each injury. The transcript seems to benarrating sports footage and describing injuries as they occur to the athletes.Overall, it provides an overview of these common sports injuries that can resultfrom overuse or sudden trauma during athletic activities
```

## Summary with specialized endpoint[​](#summary-with-specialized-endpoint "Direct link to Summary with specialized endpoint")

The [LeMUR Summary function](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/lemur/summary) requires no prompt engineering and facilitates more deterministic and structured outputs. You can use it with `transcript.lemur.summarize()`.

You can add additional context to provide information that is not explicitly referenced in the audio data, as well as specify an answer format. For this, use the optional parameters `context` and `answer_format`.

## Custom summary example (Advanced)[​](#custom-summary-example-advanced "Direct link to Custom summary example (Advanced)")

In this example, we'll run a custom LeMUR task with an advanced prompt to create custom summaries:

## More summarization prompt examples[​](#more-summarization-prompt-examples "Direct link to More summarization prompt examples")

Try any of these prompts to get started:

| Use case                 | Example prompt                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Summaries                | *"Summarize key decisions and important points from the phone call transcript"* |
| Summarize audio segments | *"Summarize the key events of each chapter"*                                    |
