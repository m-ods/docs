## Frequently asked questions[​](#frequently-asked-questions "Direct link to Frequently asked questions")

What if the model predicts the wrong sentiment label for a sentence?

The Sentiment Analysis model is based on the interpretation of the transcript and may not always accurately capture the intended sentiment of the speaker. It's recommended to take into account the context of the transcript and to validate the sentiment analysis results with human judgment when possible.

What if the transcript contains sensitive or offensive content?

The [Content Moderation model](/docs/audio-intelligence/content-moderation) can be used to identify and filter out sensitive or offensive content from the transcript.

What if the sentiment analysis results aren't consistent with my expectations?

It's important to ensure that the audio being analyzed is relevant to your use case. Additionally, it's recommended to take into account the context of the transcript and to evaluate the confidence score for each sentiment label.

What if the sentiment analysis is taking too long to process?

The Sentiment Analysis model is designed to be fast and efficient, but processing times may vary depending on the size of the audio file and the complexity of the language used. If you experience longer processing times than expected, don't hesitate to contact our support team.
