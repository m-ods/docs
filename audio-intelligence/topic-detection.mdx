## Frequently asked questions[​](#frequently-asked-questions "Direct link to Frequently asked questions")

How does the Topic Detection model handle misspelled or unrecognized words?

The Topic Detection model uses natural language processing and machine learning to identify related words and phrases even if they are misspelled or unrecognized. However, the accuracy of the detection may depend on the severity of the misspelling or the obscurity of the word.

Can I use the Topic Detection model to identify entities that aren't part of the IAB Taxonomy?

No, the Topic Detection model can only identify entities that are part of the IAB Taxonomy. The model is optimized for contextual targeting use cases, so using the predefined IAB categories ensures the most accurate results.

Why am I not getting any topic predictions for my audio file?

There could be several reasons why you aren't getting any topic predictions for your audio file. One possible reason is that the audio file doesn't contain enough relevant content for the model to analyze. Additionally, the accuracy of the predictions may be affected by factors such as background noise, low-quality audio, or a low confidence threshold for topic detection. It's recommended to review and adjust the model's configuration parameters and to provide high-quality, relevant audio files for analysis.

Why am I getting inaccurate or irrelevant topic predictions for my audio file?

There could be several reasons why you're getting inaccurate or irrelevant topic predictions for your audio file. One possible reason is that the audio file contains background noise or other non-relevant content that's interfering with the model's analysis. Additionally, the accuracy of the predictions may be affected by factors such as low-quality audio, a low confidence threshold for topic detection, or insufficient training data. It's recommended to review and adjust the model's configuration parameters, to provide high-quality, relevant audio files for analysis, and to consider adding additional training data to the model.

Is AssemblyAI associated with IAB?

As of 2023, AssemblyAI is a partner with the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), a certification and community for advertising across the internet. AssemblyAI built Topic Detection using the IAB Taxonomy, which is a blueprint of the approximately 700 topics used to categorize ads.
