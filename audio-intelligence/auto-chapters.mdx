## Frequently asked questions[​](#frequently-asked-questions "Direct link to Frequently asked questions")

Can I specify the number of chapters to be generated by the Auto Chapters model?

No, the number of chapters generated by the Auto Chapters model isn't configurable by the user. The model automatically segments the audio file into logical chapters as the topic of conversation changes.

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

Why am I not getting any chapter predictions for my audio file?

One possible reason is that the audio file doesn't contain enough variety in topic or tone for the model to identify separate chapters. Another reason could be due to background noise or low-quality audio interfering with the model's analysis.
