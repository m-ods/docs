title: "PII Redaction"
description: "The PII Redaction model lets you minimize sensitive information about individuals by automatically identifying and removing it from your transcript."
---

Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is any information that can be used to identify a person, such as a name, email address, or phone number.

When you enable the PII Redaction model, your transcript will look like this:

* With `hash` substitution: `Hi, my name is ####!`
* With `entity_name` substitution: `Hi, my name is [PERSON_NAME]!`

You can also [Create redacted audio files](#create-redacted-audio-files) to replace sensitive information with a beeping sound.

<Check>
  PII Redaction is available in multiple languages. See [Supported languages](/getting-started/supported-languages).
</Check>

<Warning>
  PII only redacts words in the `text` property. Properties from other features may still include PII, such as `entities` from [Entity Detection](/audio-intelligence/entity-detection) or `summary` from [Summarization](/audio-intelligence/summarization).
</Warning>

## Quickstart[​](#quickstart "Direct link to Quickstart")

Enable PII Redaction by setting `redact_pii` to `true` in the transcription config.

Use `redact_pii_policies` to specify the information you want to redact. For the full list of policies, see [PII policies](#pii-policies).

Smoke from hundreds of wildfires in Canada is triggering air quality alertsthroughout the US. Skylines from Maine to Maryland to Minnesota are gray andsmoggy.

## Create redacted audio files[​](#create-redacted-audio-files "Direct link to Create redacted audio files")

In addition to redacting sensitive information from the transcription text, you can also generate a version of the original audio file with the PII "beeped" out.

To create a redacted version of the audio file, use the `set_redact_pii()` method on the `TranscriptionConfig` with `redact_audio` to `True`.

Use `get_redacted_audio_url()` on the transcript to get the URL to the redacted audio file.

<Note>
  You can only create redacted audio files for transcriptions in English and Spanish.
</Note>

<Warning>
  You can only create redacted versions of audio files if the original file is smaller than 1 GB.

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

Why is the PII not redacted in my transcription?

Make sure that at least one [PII policy](#pii-policies) has been specified in your request, using the `redact_pii_policies` parameter. If you're still experiencing issues, please reach out to our support team for assistance.

Why is my webhook not being sent?

There could be several reasons why your webhook isn't being sent, such as a misconfigured URL, an unreachable endpoint, or an issue with the authentication headers. Double-check your request and ensure that the `webhook_url` parameter is included with a valid URL that can be reached by AssemblyAI's API. If you're using custom authentication headers, ensure that the `webhook_auth_header_name` and `webhook_auth_header_value` parameters are included and are correct. If you're still having issues, please contact our support team for assistance.

Why does my redacted audio file sound worse than the original?

By default, the API returns redacted audio files in MP3 format, a lossy format. Lossy formats remove audio information to reduce file size, which may cause a reduction in quality. The difference may be particularly noticeable if the submitted audio is in a lossless file format. To retain as much quality as possible, you can instead return your redacted audio files in a lossless format, by setting `redact_pii_audio_quality` to `wav`.
