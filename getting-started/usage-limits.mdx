## Speech-to-Text usage limits[​](#speech-to-text-usage-limits "Direct link to Speech-to-Text usage limits")

AssemblyAI limits the number of transcriptions being processed at any given time.

| Usage limit               | Free account | Paid account |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Concurrent transcriptions | 5            | 200          |

If you submit a transcription that would exceed your usage limit, it'll be added to a queue. Queued transcriptions will be processed automatically as previously submitted transcriptions complete.

If your account balance goes below zero, your concurrency limit will be reduced to 1.

If you exceed your concurrency limit, you'll receive an email stating that your transcripts have been throttled. Note that you'll only receive this email once per day.

<Note>
  If you're consistently exceeding the limit of concurrent sessions, first make sure that you're terminating sessions properly.

  * If you're using the [WebSocket API](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/streaming/realtime) directly, you need to send a `terminate_session` message.
  * If you're using one of the SDKs, consult the docs for the specific SDK you're using.
