To use webhooks, you need to set up your own webhook receiver to handle webhook deliveries.

## Create a webhook for a transcription[​](#create-a-webhook-for-a-transcription "Direct link to Create a webhook for a transcription")

To create a webhook, use `set_webhook()` on the transcription config. The URL must be accessible from AssemblyAI's servers.

Use `submit()` instead of `transcribe()` to create a transcription without waiting for it to complete.

## Handle webhook deliveries[​](#handle-webhook-deliveries "Direct link to Handle webhook deliveries")

When the transcript is ready, AssemblyAI will send a `POST` HTTP request to the URL that you specified.

<Note>
  AssemblyAI sends all webhook deliveries from the same IP address, 44.238.19.20.

### Delivery payload[​](#delivery-payload "Direct link to Delivery payload")

The webhook delivery payload contains a JSON object with the following properties:

```
```

| Key             | Type   | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `transcript_id` | string | The ID of the transcript.                                    |
| `status`        | string | The status of the transcript. Either `completed` or `error`. |

## Authenticate webhook deliveries[​](#authenticate-webhook-deliveries "Direct link to Authenticate webhook deliveries")

You can authenticate webhook deliveries from AssemblyAI by including a custom HTTP header in the request.

To add an authentication header, include the auth header name and value in `set_webhook()`.

## Add metadata to webhook deliveries[​](#add-metadata-to-webhook-deliveries "Direct link to Add metadata to webhook deliveries")

To associate metadata for a specific transcription request, you can add your own query parameters to the webhook URL.

```
https://example.com/webhook?customer_id=1234&order_id=5678
```

Now, when you receive the webhook delivery, you'll know the customer who requested it.

## Handling failed webhook deliveries[​](#handling-failed-webhook-deliveries "Direct link to Handling failed webhook deliveries")

Webhook deliveries can fail for multiple reasons. For example, if your server is down or takes more than 10 seconds to respond.

If a webhook delivery fails, AssemblyAI will attempt to redeliver it up to 10 times, waiting 10 seconds between each attempt. If all attempts fail, AssemblyAI considers the delivery as permanently failed.

  `submit()` returns an object with the ID of the transcription. If the webhook delivery fails, you can use this ID to retrieve the transcript later.
