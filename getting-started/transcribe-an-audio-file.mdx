## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

* Transcribe an audio file.
* Enable [Speaker Diarization](/docs/speech-to-text/speaker-diarization) to detect speakers in an audio file.

Here's the full sample code for what you'll build in this tutorial:

## Before you begin[​](#before-you-begin "Direct link to Before you begin")

To complete this tutorial, you need:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Go](https://go.dev), Java, [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download), or [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) installed.
* A .

## Step 1: Install the SDK[​](#step-1-install-the-sdk "Direct link to Step 1: Install the SDK")

Install the package via pip:

## Step 2: Configure the SDK[​](#step-2-configure-the-sdk "Direct link to Step 2: Configure the SDK")

In this step, you 'll create an SDK client and configure it to use your API key.

1. 1

   Browse to , and then click the text under **Your API key** to copy it.

2. 2

   Create a new client using your API key. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your copied API key.

## Step 3: Submit audio for transcription[​](#step-3-submit-audio-for-transcription "Direct link to Step 3: Submit audio for transcription")

In this step, you'll submit the audio file for transcription and wait until it's completes. The time it takes to process an audio file depends on its duration and the enabled models. Most transcriptions complete within 45 seconds.

1. 1

   Specify a URL to the audio you want to transcribe. The URL needs to be accessible from AssemblyAI's servers. For a list of supported formats, see [FAQ](/docs/Concepts/faq).

   <Note>
     YouTube URLs are not supported. If you want to transcribe a YouTube video, you need to download the audio first.
   </Note>

2. 2

   To generate the transcript, pass the audio URL to `transcribe()`.

   This may take a minute while we're processing the audio.

   <Check>
     You can select the class of models to use in order to make cost-performance tradeoffs best suited for your application. See [Select the speech model](/docs/speech-to-text/speech-recognition#select-the-speech-model-with-best--nano).
   </Check>

3. 3

   If the transcription failed, the `status` of the transcription will be set to `error`. To see why it failed you can print the value of `error`.

4. 4

   Print the complete transcript.

5. 5

   Run the application and wait for it to finish.

You've successfully transcribed your first audio file. You can see all submitted transcription jobs in the .

## Step 4: Enable additional AI models[​](#step-4-enable-additional-ai-models "Direct link to Step 4: Enable additional AI models")

You can extract even more insights from the audio by enabling any of our [AI models](/docs/audio-intelligence) using *transcription options*. In this step, you'll enable the [Speaker diarization](/docs/speech-to-text/speaker-diarization) model to detect who said what.

1. 1

   Create a `TranscriptionConfig` with `speaker_labels` set to `True`, and then pass it as the second argument to `transcribe()`.

2. 2

   In addition to the full transcript, you now have access to utterances from each speaker.

Many of the properties in the transcript object only become available after you enable the corresponding model. For more information, see the models under [Speech-to-Text](/docs/speech-to-text) and [Audio Intelligence](/docs/audio-intelligence).

## Next steps[​](#next-steps "Direct link to Next steps")

In this tutorial, you've learned how to generate a transcript for an audio file and how to extract speaker information by enabling the [Speaker diarization](/docs/speech-to-text/speaker-diarization) model.
