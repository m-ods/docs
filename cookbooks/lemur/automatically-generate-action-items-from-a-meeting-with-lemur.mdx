In this guide, you'll learn how to use AssemblyAI [LeMUR](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/api-reference/lemur/task) to process an audio file and then automatically generate action items from the meeting's transcript.

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

Before we begin, make sure you have an AssemblyAI account and an API key. You can [sign up for an AssemblyAI account](https://www.assemblyai.com/app) and get your API key from your dashboard.

LeMUR features are currently only available to paid users at two pricing tiers, LeMUR Default and LeMUR Basic. Refer to our [pricing page](https://www.assemblyai.com/pricing) for more detail.

## Step-by-step instructions[​](#step-by-step-instructions "Direct link to Step-by-step instructions")

In this guide, you'll use AssemblyAI to transcribe a meeting recording. Then, you'll request a list of action items from LeMUR.

1. Import the `assemblyai` package and set your API key



```python 
import assemblyai as aai
aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY" 
```

2. Use the `Transcriber` object's `transcribe` method and pass in the audio file's path as a parameter. The `transcribe` method will save the results of the transcription to the `Transcribe` object's `transcript` attribute.


```python Python
transcriber = aai.Transcriber()
transcript = transcriber.transcribe("meeting.mp3")
```

    
3. Define your LeMUR request `context` and `answer_format` parameters for the Action Items feature.


```python Python
# context is any information that would not be present in the transcript but may be helpful to know when generating action items
context = """This is a Product team meeting from 2019-07-09.
            Generate Action Items from the meeting in the following format:"""
# answer_format defines how you want the action items from LeMUR to be presented.
answer_format = """
            Action Item Title: A brief, descriptive title that summarizes the action item.
            Assignee: The person who is responsible for completing the action item.
            Due Date: The deadline for completing the action item.
            Status: The current status of the action item (e.g., "In progress", "Completed", "Deferred").
            Notes: Any additional notes or information about the action item."""
```

4. Run the `action_items` method on `transcript` and print the result to your terminal.


```python Python
result = transcript.lemur.task(prompt)

print(result.response)
```
